  <p>Hello. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>My name is Joseph Nwoke. I am an international student from Nigeria and this is my second year at IIT. It is my first year as an ITM major but I started out as a CS major. I love video games and would love to be able to make them with the knowledge I am pursuing at IIT. I am a massive FC Barcelona fan and also love watching WWE and sci-fi tv shows and movies. Thanks for reading.  </p>
